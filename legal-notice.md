All website contents are duly protected by intellectual and industrial property laws, and are registered in the corresponding public registries.

Regardless of their intended purpose, the total or partial reproduction, use, exploitation, distribution and commercialisation, requires in any case the prior written authorisation from the CONTROLLER.

### Use of Cookies
This website uses technical cookies (small files with information that the server sends to the computer of the website user) in order to carry out certain functions considered necessary for the correct functioning and preview of the website. In any case, the cookies used are temporary, with the sole purpose of making navigation of the site more efficient, and disappear at the end of the user’s session. Under no circumstances do these cookies themselves provide personal data and will not be used for the collection of such data.

Through using cookies, it is also possible for the server where the website is located to recognise the browser used by the user in order to make navigation easier, allowing, for example, users who have previously registered to access the areas, services, promotions or contests reserved exclusively for them without having to register on each visit. They may also be used to measure the audience or traffic parameters, monitor the progress and number of entries, etc. In these cases, the cookies used are technically non-essential but beneficial to the user. This website will not install non-essential cookies without previous user consent.

The browser may be configured by the user to alert them of the reception of cookies and to prevent their installation on their computer. For further information, please consult the instructions of your browser.

### Link policy
The user of this website may be redirected to content from third party websites. Since the CONTROLLER cannot always control the contents of third-party websites, they do not assume any type of responsibility with respect to said contents. In any case, the CONTROLLER will immediately remove any content that may be in breach of national or international laws, morality or public order, and will immediately remove the redirection to this website, informing the competent authorities of the content in question.

The CONTROLLER will not be responsible for the information and content found, including but not limited to, in forums, chats, blog generators, comments, social networks or any other means that allows third parties to publish content independently on the website of the CONTROLLER. However, and in accordance with Acts 11 and 16 of the LSSICE, third party content is made available to all users, authorities, and law enforcement bodies collaborating directly on the withdrawal or blocking of all content that may affect or violate national or international law, third party rights or public morals and public order. In the event that the user considers there to be any content on the website that could be considered as such, please notify the website administrator immediately.

This website was revised and tested to enable its correct functioning. In principle, proper functioning can be guaranteed 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. However, the CONTROLLER does not rule out the possibility of there being certain programming errors, or that force majeure, natural disasters, strikes or similar circumstances may occur that make accessing the website impossible.

### IP Addresses
The website servers can detect automatically the IP address and the domain name used by the user. An IP address is a number assigned automatically to a computer when connected to the Internet. All of this information is recorded in a system log on the server that allows the subsequent processing of the data in order to obtain only statistical measurements that show us the number of page hits, the number of visits made to the web servers, the order of visits, the access point, etc.

## 4. APPLICABLE LAW AND JURISDICTION
Spanish legislation shall apply to the resolution of all disputes or questions related to this website or the activities carried out therein, to which the parties expressly submit themselves, and the Courts and Tribunals of the USER’s domicile or the place of fulfilment of the obligation shall be competent for the resolution of all disputes arising from or related to its use.
